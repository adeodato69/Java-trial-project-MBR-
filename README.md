# Java-trial-project-MBR-
The first java project I had part in its creation
Read the "MBR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.doc" file for description of how the project functions and works including the database details.
Quick heads up...the project code was created, debugged and run using Apache Netbeans IDE, just thought it'll be important because I tried to run it using a different IDE and had a few problems with that. I'm sure some of you who might see this will know what to do (and I will too eventually) but for those of us who don't the message is for you( or is it us :) )
